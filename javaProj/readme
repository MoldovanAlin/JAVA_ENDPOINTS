I created a simple CRUD Rest Web service application with Java. I defined this project as a Spring Boot project along with the dependencies to connect the database. The interface extends JpaRepository and the two generic types defined are the entity class and the type of its primary key. 

I created a new class for handling exception.

I hope I understood well how is the flow between users and savings account. I was thinking that a user can open a savings account and if he doesn't have, the user can be updated (with PUT http method) with a new savings account.

The endpoints are marked there. First is users and the second is for each user in part.
